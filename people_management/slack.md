Reflections of a new manager:

Hi, my name is Ridhwana and I'm a recovering slack addict.

Situation

Ever since becoming a Lead Engineer, I've found myself browsing Slack the way that I would browse Instagram or Twitter. It has become a form of social media, but a social media that is work related, except for the cute cat and dog pictures in the #aww channel.

I've been constantly checking slack - when I open my eyes in the morning, I reach onto my bedside table and the first app my groggy eyes see is my Slack app. I lay in bed for the next half hour going through messages.

By the time I get up and have my breakfast I already feel stressed out and anxious to respond to the messages that I've missed overnight. The UTC- portion of the team that had worked through my night had @'ed me on questions, required feedback, PR Reviews, and much more. I store all of this in my brain and realize that it would be pointless to ease into my day any longer. I needed to jump right into it and respond to these messages (even though the team would only see it when they started their day 7 hours later).


Psychology of stating your day stressed out.


As a new manager there's a ton to collaborate on!

Whilst I'm be coding out a feature, I find myself constantly switching to Slack, just to check if I've missed out on something, thereby disrupting any potential flow state that I may have had.

For anyone that has practiced flow state, you'll know that ....


I'll be responding to one Slack message and then get distracted by another one, only to find myself coming up for air after a couple of hours realizing that I've switched context multiple times already.

The cost of of context switching can lead to approximately a 40% decrease in productivity over time. multi-taskinghttps://www.inc.com/laura-montini/infographic/the-high-cost-of-multitasking.html



I often find myself justifying being on slack after hours with the following thoughts:

- "Maybe someone needs something from me and I can help out quickly"
- "Oh but this person won't be able to move forward without my input right now"
- "I wonder if I've missed anything important"
- "i have nothing better to do at the moment, I'll just tae a quic pea to see what everyone is up to"

Impact

As a result of my recent addiction to Slack, I find that I'm unable to switch off from work mode. I feel a level of anxiety when I'm away from Slac, and if I'm doing nothing better than I've devdeloped a sesne of guilt that I'm not chceing my messages.

I've been trying to evaulate why I feel the need to og onto slac so that I can provide myself with a sense of awareness.

maybe because most of the team is in the US and I feel the "need" to be online. Perhaps, I don't feel secure enough in our asynchronous worflow as a new manager. Sometimes, I just want to help others and unbloc them immediately. It could also just be straight out FOMO

Theres been numerous times when team members have encouragesd me to now log off because they can see that its late for me:

This has urged me to think more deepy abut the type of manager I want to become. I want to lead by example, I cannot be telling my team that they should log of and maiintain their wor life balance whne my actions portray something different.

In addition, its not helpful for myself or my team's long term productivity if I cannot maintain a good wor life balance that enables me to witch off when I need to relax and return fresh the nexyt day ready to be productive.


Action

As a result, over the lat couple of weeks I've been more intentional about logging off. When I'm done at my laptop I add a status that states that I'm done for the day. I also set myself on do not disturb. If i've just engaged in a conversation then I as others if they require anything else and let others now that I will be logging off.I try and be offline by a certain  time every day.

I do not enable notifications on my phone and put myself in reax mode so that I I cant browse slac lie a social media


THere will be times when I need to be online to collaborate with someone but I am intentional about it.


Result

Last wee I slipped and ended up checing slac until 9PM. However, I am holding my self accpuontable and trying to be better both for mysefl and my mental healtha s well as for my team.




Ideas:
- Lead by example
- Fear of missing out
- Incorporate science (congnitive load, how the brain works)
