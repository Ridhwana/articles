Hi, my name is Ridhwana and I'm a recovering slack addict.

Hi, my name is Ridhwana and ever since I got a promotion to Lead Engineer, I've become somewhat of a Slack addict.


Situation

Ever smce becoming a Lead Engineer, I found myself browsing Slack the way that someone would  browse Twitter or Instagram. It was my form of social media, but a social media that was work related. I found myself constantly chceking slack - when I opened my eyes in the morning, I reached onto my bedside table pulled down the menu on my phone and there right at the top on my recently browsed was my Slack app. I opene dit and lay in bed for the next half hour going through messages.


Starting my day:
By the time I got up and had my breakfast I already felt stressed out and anxious to respond to the message that I'd missed in the 12-14 hours that I had been offline. The UTC- portion of the team that ad worked through my night had @'ed me on questions, rrequired feedback, PR Reviews, and much more. I stored all of this in my brain and realized that it would be pointless to ease into my day  any longer. I needed to jump right into it and respond to these messages (even though the team would only see it when they started their day 7 hours later).

During the day:

As a new manager I find myself spedning a lot of time on Slak or our dedicated team Forem. This is to askycnchronously work out the kinks of a projects or collaborate a design .
