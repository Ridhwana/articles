#My experiences as a Lead Engineer - leading a small team at Forem

I recently ( a month ago ) got promoted to a Lead Engineer. This promotion involved officially leading what Forem calls the Admin Experience Team and also being a direct manager for folks on my team.  

I plan on documenting this journey and so I thought what better way to do it than to start of by outlining:
1. My responsibilities
2. What my team does
3. Who do I interact with
4. What do I want to achieve over time

I've been informally leading the team for a few months now, and we're a really small team at the moment with just four people including myself. The team consists of a designer and 3 engineers. We have a really good mix of skillsets and experience levels too.

The Admin Experience team is responsible for the creator and admin journey on Forem. We are working on improving the onboarding of creators so that they can set up their Forems more easily. In addition, we have what we call the /admin section that is responsible for Customization, Content Management, Moderator tools, Advanced developer tools, and User management. These tools give power to the creator and admins of Forems so that they are able to effectively setup, manage and grow their Forem. I'm really passionate about the work that I'm doing and feel motivated by the improvements that I can make in this area.

Here is an outline of our goals as a team:

My management position is a mix of IC management and people management.

As a team manager I am responsible for:
1. Making sure that projects are on track.
2. Unblocking my team.
3. Clarifying priorities.
4. Helping to architect solutions to our problems.
6. Ensuring that team members feel supported.
5. I also continue coding on a daily basis.

As a people manager, I conduct 1-1 meetings. I am responsible for:
1. Providing them with support.
2. Advocating for them.
3. Helping to align their work to their interests.
4. Providing them with feedback.

There may be more responsibilities that I will discover as I walk this journey, and as I grow in this role, I'm keen to document my experiences and my learnings. My reason for doing this is a bit selfish - it's mostly so that I can reflect on my interactions and challenge myself to improve in this role. Maybe you'll join me on this journey? and we could learn a thing or two from each other.
