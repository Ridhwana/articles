# Reflections of a Lead Engineer - leading a small team at Forem

I recently ( in November 2021 ) got promoted to a Lead Engineer. This promotion involved leading what Forem calls the Admin Experience Team at Forem and also being a direct manager to some folks on my team.

Over the past few months I've been exploring how to get better at my role. I've been overcoming some challenges and I'm learning to adapt to my new position. At the end of each week I spend time reflecting on how I've spent my time, the value that I've added, the milestones that I've achieved, and the challenges that I've experienced and overcame.

It occurred to me that whilst I'm reflecting I could document this journey - perhaps my learnings could help others on a similar journey or help those debating whether to make a move towards a Lead Engineering role.

In this introduction post I'll outline:
1. What led me to this role
2. What my team does and our goals
3. My responsibilities as a Lead Engineer
4. What do I want to achieve over time

Thereafter, each subsequent post will be themed around a single reflection.

### What led me to this role

I've been working in the industry for about 10 years now. I started my career at a corporate where I worked for about 3 years. I then co-founded a company and consulted through my company for about 4 years. Thereafter, I worked at a startup based in the US, creating products for Africa. It was at this point that I realized that I loved working at startups because I could have direct impact on making a difference to the lives of people through software. I enjoyed the challenges and the contributions that I could make towards the growth of products within startups. When I was offered a job at Forem, I jumped at the opportunity because it was [in line with my interests](https://dev.to/ridhwana/a-new-year-with-a-new-dev-adventure-9en). This month will be my second anniversary at Forem.

I'd never thought of going into a management role. It pains me to say this, but my experiences of being a women in the industry had me constantly needing to prove that have I have "hardcore" IC engineering skills, thus going into management would have felt like defeat. As I type this out I realize how toxic that way of thinking and I wish that my past experiences did not lead to that train of thought. Also, there were not women that I interacted with within leadership roles at the time.

As I progressed in my career, I became more confident in myself and my abilities and overcame the need to constantly prove myself. I still didn't think of being a manager.

However, when I got assigned a new manager and we chatted through my career growth, we touched on the things that I enjoyed doing. I already knew that I enjoy coding. I also enjoy mentoring and helping others with their career growth. In addition, I'm a really organized person with a sense of discipline that can start something and take it to completion. I enjoy a sense of responsibility that drives me. This combined with some other skillsets helped my manager identify that perhaps I would enjoy a Lead Engineer role, with more leadership opportunities.

He encouraged me to explore options that I enjoy. It was around that time that I was provided with an opportunity to lead the effort to improve the Admin Experience team which later confirmed for me that I enjoyed part IC Engineering, but I actually do enjoy management. Coding and the leadership of the team filled me with a greater sense of purpose and fulfilment.

And that is how I landed up with a promotion to a Lead Engineer....

### What my team does and our goals

The Admin Experience team is a really small team at the moment with just four people including myself. The team consists of a designer and 3 engineers. We have a really good mix of skillsets and experience levels.

The team is responsible for the creator and admin journey on Forem. We are working on improving the onboarding for creators so that they can set up their Forems more easily. In addition, we have what we call the `/admin` section that is responsible for Customization, Content Management, Moderator tools, Advanced developer tools, and User management. These tools give power to the creator and admins of Forems so that they are able to effectively setup, manage and grow their Forem. I'm really passionate about the work that I'm doing and feel motivated by the improvements that I can make in this area.

The goals of our team are to help improve the Setup, Management and Growth of Forems.

### My responsibilities as a Lead Engineer

As a team manager I am responsible for:
1. Making sure that projects are on track.
2. Unblocking my team.
3. Clarifying priorities.
4. Helping to architect solutions to our problems.
6. Ensuring that team members feel supported.
5. I also continue coding on a daily basis.

As a people manager, I conduct 1-1 meetings. I am responsible for:
1. Providing them with support.
2. Advocating for them.
3. Helping to align their work to their interests.
4. Providing them with feedback.

I'll expand on these responsibilities as I continue growing in my role.

As a Lead Engineer, I interact with Product, Design and Engineers to fit the pieces of a puzzle together in order to bring a feature to life.

### What do I want to achieve over time

My aim as a Lead Engineer is to make an impact on the people that I work with as well as the projects that I run. I also aim to be a supportive manager who helps to enhance career growth on my team.

There may be more responsibilities that I will discover as I walk this journey, and as I grow in this role, I'm keen to document my experiences and my learnings. My reason for doing this is a bit selfish - it's mostly so that I can reflect on my interactions and challenge myself to improve in this role. Maybe you'll join me on this journey? and we could learn a thing or two from each other.
