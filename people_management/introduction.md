# My experiences as a Lead Engineer - leading a small team at Forem

I recently ( a month ago ) got promoted to a Lead Engineer. This promotion involved officially leading what Forem calls the Admin Experience Team and also being a direct manager for folks on my team.

I've been informally leading the team for a few months now, and during this time I've experienced the good and the bad. I've overcome some challenges and I'm learning to adapt to my new position. At the end of each week I spend time reflecting on how I spent my time, the value that I've added, the milestones that I've achieved, and the challenges that I've experienced and overcame.

It occurred to me that whilst I'm reflecting I could document this journey - maybe my learnings could help others on a similar journey or help those hoping to make a move towards a Lead Engineering role.

In this introduction post I'll outline:
1. My career timeline
2. What my team does and our goals
3. My responsibilities
4. Who I interact with
5. What do I want to achieve over time

Thereafter, each subsequent post will be themed around a single reflection.

### My career timeline

### What my team does and our goals
We're a really small team at the moment with just four people including myself. The team consists of a designer and 3 engineers. We have a really good mix of skillsets and experience levels too.

The Admin Experience team is responsible for the creator and admin journey on Forem. We are working on improving the onboarding of creators so that they can set up their Forems more easily. In addition, we have what we call the /admin section that is responsible for Customization, Content Management, Moderator tools, Advanced developer tools, and User management. These tools give power to the creator and admins of Forems so that they are able to effectively setup, manage and grow their Forem. I'm really passionate about the work that I'm doing and feel motivated by the improvements that I can make in this area.

Here is an **outline of our goals** as a team:

[1] Setup - Help creators set up their incomplete Forem so that:
- They're proud to share it with others. (emotional)
- It is set up exactly the way they hope it works. (functional/fits expectations)
- They plant the seeds with the first few members. (social network)

[2] Manage - Help creators manage their Forem so that:
- It remains safe, inclusive, and secure (trust & safety; security)
- Everyone finds value in engaging with the community (engagement)
- Creators & admins understand what's going on behind the scenes (analytics)
- They can edit and tweak it as they as they go

[3] Grow - Help creators grow their Forem so that:
- They reap the rewards (sometimes monetary) for their business, organization, or community (monetization)

My management position is a mix of IC management and people management.

### My responsibilities

As a team manager I am responsible for:
1. Making sure that projects are on track.
2. Unblocking my team.
3. Clarifying priorities.
4. Helping to architect solutions to our problems.
6. Ensuring that team members feel supported.
5. I also continue coding on a daily basis.

As a people manager, I conduct 1-1 meetings. I am responsible for:
1. Providing them with support.
2. Advocating for them.
3. Helping to align their work to their interests.
4. Providing them with feedback.

### Who do I interact with

### What do I want to achieve over time

My aim as a Lead Engineer is to make an impact on the people that I work with and to be a supportive manager that enhances my teams career.   

There may be more responsibilities that I will discover as I walk this journey, and as I grow in this role, I'm keen to document my experiences and my learnings. My reason for doing this is a bit selfish - it's mostly so that I can reflect on my interactions and challenge myself to improve in this role. Maybe you'll join me on this journey? and we could learn a thing or two from each other.
