Since the pandamic in 2020, many companies have moved to an async-first distributed team model, and as a result there are many opportunities available for developers to work for other companies within a different country in the world.

Many folks found themselve thrown into a remote situation for the first time and had to adapt. I feel thankful that I had many years of practice by that time.

My first job graduating from university almost 10 years ago was a async-friendly environment. Thereafter, I moved onto to consulting, which was async friendly. My next job was workig for a US company again, however, the team was still predominantly based in the United States, and then finally I joined DEV where the team was completely distributed across multiple timezones. During my time at DEV we've had team members across United States of America, Thailand, India, United Kingdom, North America and me, being based in South Africa.


I want to emaphasize that async-friendly and async-first are not the same. Let's talk about them:

Async-friendly:

Async friendly refers to a situation where a company has folks asynchronous, however it is not their primary way of working. They are friendly towards syncronous processes but they do not consider it a mandate.

If you in an office space it could be a hybrid model.


Async first is when a company works in a mannner where they place value on synch
